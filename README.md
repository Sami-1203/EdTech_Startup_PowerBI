# EdTech_Startup_PowerBI
An EdTech startup aims to expand its range of recorded lecture offerings by leveraging data collected from various EdTech platforms. This project focuses on cleaning, analyzing, and interpreting that data to uncover meaningful insights that can drive strategic growth.

The analysis explores key trends and patterns related to course categories, viewership, and engagement levels to identify areas of strength and improvement. An interactive dashboard has been developed to present these findings, with a particular emphasis on category-wise insights — helping the company understand which types of courses attract the most learners and where further opportunities exist to enhance performance.
